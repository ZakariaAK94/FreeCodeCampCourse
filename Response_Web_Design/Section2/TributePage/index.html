        <h2>Literary Career and Major Works: </h2>
        <p> Mahfouz's literary output spans over five decades, during which he wrote more than 35 novels, hundreds of short stories, and several plays.
           His works can be divided into three phases:</p>   
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Novels (Historical Fiction):</strong> 
                His early works, such as The Struggle of Thebes (1944) and Rhadopis of Nubia (1943), are historical novels that explore ancient Egypt. 
                They reflect his early fascination with history and mythology.          
            </li>
            <li><strong>The Realist Phase:</strong>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Trilogy (Palace Walk, Palace of Desire, Sugar Street, 1956–1957):</strong> 
                  This trilogy is his most famous work, depicting the lives of a middle-class Cairo family over several generations. It captures 
                    the political and social changes in Egypt during the early 20th century, including British occupation, the 1919 revolution, and the rise 
                    of modern Egypt. </li>
                 <li><strong>The Thief and the Dogs (1961):</strong> A psychological novel that explores themes of revenge and betrayal in post-revolutionary Egypt. 
                  This novel showcases Mahfouz’s engagement with modernist techniques and existential themes.</li>
                 <li><strong>Midaq Alley (1947):</strong> Set in a small alleyway in Cairo, this novel portrays the everyday lives of ordinary Egyptians and reflects Mahfouz's deep connection 
                  to his homeland.</li>
              </ul>              
            </li>
            <li><strong>Modern and Existentialist Works:</strong>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>he Harafish (1977):</strong> A sweeping, multi-generational saga of a family in Cairo, it’s a profound exploration of power, justice, and morality.</li>
                <li><strong>Children of Gebelawi (1959):</strong> This novel, often regarded as Mahfouz’s most controversial, uses allegory to retell the stories of major 
                  religious figures (such as Moses, Jesus, and Muhammad), setting them in the context of a Cairo slum. The novel was banned in Egypt and 
                  many Arab countries for its religious content.</li>
              </ul>             
            </li>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Social Change and Egyptian Identity:</strong> Mahfouz’s works often reflect on Egypt’s transition from a traditional society to a modern state, exploring
           the impact of colonialism, nationalism, and urbanization.</li>
        <li><strong>Existentialism:</strong> Later in his career, Mahfouz’s works began to reflect existentialist themes, dealing with questions of fate, free will, and the human condition.</li>
        <li><strong>Class and Social Injustice:</strong> His novels frequently explore the lives of the poor and marginalized, capturing the struggles of working-class Egyptians
           and the inequalities in society.</li>
